# ArchiMob corpus Preprocessing for Mozilla DeepSpeech

 <p> The importer pre-processes the audio-and text-data so that it can be used with the open-source Speech-to-Text engine DeepSpeech. This repository is forked from *tobiasrordorf/archimob-swissgerman-deepspeech-importer*. Please reach out to <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiasrordorf'>Tobias Rordorf</a> for specifics.

**I have edited ReadMe and a few files so it can directly be used for <a href='https://github.com/AASHISHAG/deepspeech-swiss-german'>deepspeech-swiss-german</a> repository.**  </p>
